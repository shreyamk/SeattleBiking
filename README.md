# Seattle Biking Trends

'Bicycling' magazine has ranked Seattle as the #1 biking city in the US this year. Decided it would be fun to do an exploratory analysis of biking traffic across different parts of the city!

This analysis is based on Biking counter data of Fremont, Burke-Gilmann, Greenway and Broadway cycling trails.

I used a [dataset](https://data.seattle.gov/Transportation) that was published by the Seattle Department of Transportation as part of Seattle's Open Data Program.

The code, plots and analysis can be viewed in the 'seattle_biking.ipynb' file in this repository.
