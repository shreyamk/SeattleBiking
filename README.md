# SeattleBiking

'Bicycling' magazine has ranked Seattle as the #1 biking city in the US this year. Thought it would be fun to do an exploratory analysis of biking traffic across different parts of the city!

This analysis is based on Biking counter data of Fremont, Burke-Gilmann, Greenway and Broadway cycling trails.

I used the link below to obtain data that was published as part of Seattle's Open Data Program:
